    <strong>Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This web application is for NUS students to pour their hearts out anonymously to each other in a conversation, and hopefully both party gain some insight,
    advice or support regarding their problems.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Motivation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Some people may feel uncomfortable with sharing their feelings/problems/thoughts to their friends. This is due to some reasons, including but not limited
    to the fear of being judged. They still want to seek some advice or gain some insight, but they want their identity undisclosed. This web-based chat
    application will enable them to do exactly that.

    User Stories
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        As a user who is uncomfortable with sharing my personal problem to my close ones, I want to be able to chat anonymously to someone who would listen to
        me so I can relieve my anxiety.
    </li>
    <li>
        As a user, I want to be able to start a new conversation so that I can chat with another person if I don’t like the current person I’m talking to.
    </li>
    <li>
        As a user, I want to be able to identify the user I am talking to if both of us click and both of us agree to identify one another so that we can make
        friends.
    </li>
    <li>
        As a user, I want to be able to view my chat history so that i can read through them just in case i wanted to do so.

<p>
    There is no video provided for this milestone because apparently we have not implemented any feature yet. The reason for the delay in our implementation is
    that in early June, for about two weeks, Riani was having a certification bootcamp and meanwhile Teddy was overseas. We were unable to devote our time for
    Orbital during that time. After we’re done with those, we spent our time learning the MEAN stack. Unexpected to us, learning the MEAN stack took longer
    than what we predicted. Therefore, we have to postpone our implementation of the chat app. We also came to realize that building a chat app is far more
    complicated than what we have imagined previously. Because of that, we even have to re-evaluate our user stories and planned features. We have informed
    Prof Min Yen about our situation, and he advised us to submit the video in milestone 3. We will put in more effort this July to finish the whole chat app.
